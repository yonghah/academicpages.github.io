This tool, GlayAn, provides a comprehensive visualization and data management tool 
that designers or analysts can use to evaluate workplace layout.

By developing this tool as a plugin of a GIS package, we can demonstrate several 
important advantages of conducting layout analysis using GIS such as customizable 
visualization, easier management and manipulation of complex datasets, the utilization 
of ready-made front-end, and rich ecosystem. This study will examine the above 
advantages through practical analysis examples.

GlayAn is a comprehensive set of tools to intended to support the various analytical 
methods proposed by scholars and practitioners in this field to analyze workplace 
layout. Currently, GlayAn consists of five core analysis modules: overall visibility, 
visibility between workstations, closest facility, distance matrix among colleagues, 
and angular exposure from windows. More modules are under development.
