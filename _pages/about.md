I am Yongha Hwang, a full-stack GIS developer working at the Space Information and Planning, University of Michigan Medical School. I am leading a development team for MGIS which is a web application for visualizing indoor spaces at the University of Michigan. The system visualizes campus facilities at the room level using GIS system with administrative datasets.

I also consider myself as a geospatial data scientist. My research topic during my PhD was to quantitatively analyze the effect of workspaceâ€™s layout on collaboration behavior. While working on that, I realized that tools for quantitative analysis are scarce in this field despite recent dazzling advances in data sciences in other fields. 

My current interest is to help the inquiry of architecture and urban design by introducing such advances in data sciences, machine learning, and deep learning to this field.
